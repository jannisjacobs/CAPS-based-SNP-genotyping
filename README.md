# CAPS-based-SNP-genotyping
The files in this repository accompany the Bio-protocol manuscript titled "CAPS-based SNP genotyping for nitrogen-response phenotypes in maize hybrids". The purpose of these files is to help sort through large numbers of SNPs as well as a gel prediction script. These work best with .HMP files.
