# CAPS-based-SNP-genotyping
The files in this repository accompany the Bio-protocol manuscript titled "CAPS-based SNP genotyping for nitrogen-response phenotypes in maize hybrids". The purpose of these files is to help sort through large numbers of SNPs as well as a gel prediction script. These work best with .HMP files. An example of such an file has been added. The CAPS_gel_prediction.ipynb script may need editing if your HMP format varies. Manual entries for the SNP of each genotype is not currently supported by the script.

This repository also contains the code file used for sorting SNPs. This code has not been tailored to be interactive.
